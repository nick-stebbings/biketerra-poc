After making a quick POC with Tauri 2, I'd like to first lay out the additional complexities with making a multi-platform production ready version of this app, before making an estimate.

- Security concerns regarding IPC message passing: The default Tauri pattern for IPC (as demonstrated) does not provide a completely secure contract between the Rust code/webview and I would want to leverage the interceptor pattern to ensure a watertight security policy is implemented, adding some additional time and complexity.
- Background services: As you are aware from your talk on Discord with other community members, this is not a solved problem for Tauri 2 on all platforms. This is two pronged (iOS, Android), and for the Android case I believe I can fork/adapt https://github.com/holochain/android-service-runtime which shouldn't add too much time. The iOS side I will need more research for and is listed as unknown in the estimate. It's worth noting that any extra functionality e.g. notifications based on connection/disconnection will require either foreground UI or additional notification plugin which is not included in the estimate.
- Test coverage: depending on your project needs you may have different levels of coverage that need to be met. I suggest adding some end-to-end testing with Playwright to ensure front-end integration works as expected. This could optionally include penetration testing of the security layer/interceptor mentioned above. Unit testing of commands will be done as standard.
- Multi platform deployment: This, in my experience, takes a while to setup (you also have issues such as code-signing on Windows, MacOS). I would expect hold-ups here but setting up a solid CI/CD pipeline would be one of the first things to get right to avoid headaches down the line.
- `btleplug` missing functionality: The core estimate assumes that the crate covers all needed functionality. If any additional functionality is needed, this will require a fork and would hold things up considerably (since the crate does so much heavy lifting for us). I am fairly confident that this will not be needed.

Given the above context, I can make the following estimates for your spec.

## Time Estimate Summary

- **Core Development**: 45-60 hours
- Beyond `btleplug` functionality - Unknown
- **Cross-Platform Adaptation (including Swift/Kotlin versions of plugin)**: 45-60 hours
- **Mobile Background Processes**: 10-15 hours (Android) + Unknown (iOS)
- **Testing**: 20-60 hours (2/3rds of this will be optional e2e/penetration testing/benchmarking)
- **CI/CD**: 16-22 hours
- **Documentation and Handoff**: 3-6 hours
- **Buffer for unexpected issues**: 30-45 hours

**Without Optionals/Unknowns**
- Core Development: 45-60 hours
- Cross-Platform Adaptation: 45-60 hours
- Mobile Background Processes (Android only): 10-15 hours
- Testing (assuming basic scope): 20-25 hours
- CI/CD: 16-22 hours
- Documentation and Handoff: 3-6 hours
**Subtotal (without unknowns/optionals):** 139-188 hours


**With Optionals/Buffer (but without unknowns):**
- Add 30-40 hours testing
- Add 30-45 hours buffer
- Total: 199-273 hours
